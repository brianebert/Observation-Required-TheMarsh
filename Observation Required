SF City Front

WOMAN
Thanks for suggesting the walk.

MAN
You’re welcome.  I enjoy your company.

WOMAN
These waves sound awesome, crashing this seawall.

MAN
We like to say they begin in Japan and roll all the way here.

WOMAN
You see at that guy down where we’re parked?

MAN
(We continued down the seawall at a more wary pace)
The guy just standing there?  What do you think he’s doing?

WOMAN
Hopefully not casing cars.  This spot is pretty low traffic, auto or pedestrian.

MAN
Maybe don’t be obvious the way you look at him.
(Woman and Man pause, look into each other’s eyes.)
I’m just saying.


 BLACK MAN
(Walking toward Woman and Man.  Woman and Man turn gaze out onto the bay.) BLACK MAN
Whatchoo lookin at?

MAN
Uh, nothin.

BLACK MAN
Nothin?  I thought you could be lookin’ at the waves reflecting off this wall.

MAN
What? Um, yeah.

BLACK MAN
See em go out, after the wave hits the wall?

MAN
(look more carefully)  
Oh yeah, I see that.  What’s going on when the one going out hits one coming in.  They seem to stand up tall at that point where they meet.

BLACK MAN
They do.  It’s got a fancy name: superposition.  It means they add.

MAN
We like to say they roll all the way across the Pacific from Japan.

BLACK MAN
That’s exactly what happened during the Fukushima disaster.

MAN
Really?

BLACK MAN
Yeah.  We got a smaller wave here, but it was still big.  California stopped it like this wall, except for gaps like that.
(He points toward the Golden Gate)
All of these waves are coming through that gap.

MAN
The Golden Gate?

BLACK MAN
UmHmm.

MAN
If the waves are coming from the Golden Gate, how to they turn and crash into this wall on the city front?

BLACK MAN
When they pass through that gap they arch, like a ladies’ hand fan.  There are waves across the slot here, fanning into Belvedere Island.

WOMAN
Wouldn’t it be wild if there were two gaps.

BLACK MAN
Sure, the arching waves would cross each other, adding like the reflections from this wall, in superposition with its companion arch.  It’s got a little less fancy name: interference pattern.

NEWTON
 It seems like some small packet, a tiny corpuscle.  I could describe many properties of these corpuscles…                           HUYGENS
 But Newton, what we observe of light is much better explained by considering it a wave.                             NEWTON Huygens, you may have invented the pendulum clock, discovered the rings of Saturn and its moon Titan, but I’m Newton!                               ACADEMY Here, here, yes, yes, he’s Newton! 
NARATOR The scientific revolution honored its orthodoxy.  For a while.  But in 1802 a guy named Thomas Young created a sort of wall with a pair of gaps for waves of light.  The gaps were narrow slits, giving Young’s experiment its name: the double slit experiment.   Young found an interference pattern
(Show hand fans crossing)
 and proved Newton wrong.

Scene 3
19th century France

MONET
Renoir, I love how you’ve softened the edges in your portraits.  It frees my attention to indulge your rich palette.

RENOIR
Thank you, Monet.  Your own abstraction of flowers has helped me disregard form. I paint light itself.

MONET
That is why I paint outdoors so often, awash in waves of light dancing off of the water.

RENOIR
What do you make of this kid, Seurat, Monet?  I cannot feel waves of light from those tiny points he makes.

MONET
I understand your feeling of the tip of his brush, but stepping back, those tiny, discrete points of light combine to produce a rich image of reality.

Scene 4
Late 19th century Germany

EINSTEIN
This is very interesting, Hertz.  Shining light on this material produces electricity?

HERTZ
Yes, Einstein.  We can observe this in my lab.  The only issue is that known properties of light waves do not explain the relationship between the light and the electricity produced.

EINSTEIN
It’s almost as if the light were behaving like Newton’s corpuscle.

HERTZ
But we know from Young’s double slit experiment that light is a wave.

EINSTEIN
But your lab indicates it is acting like some sort of packet, or particle, like Seurat’s little points.

HERTZ
How could small packets of light produce the wave interference pattern of the double slit experiment.

EINSTEIN
Hmm.  Let me give it a little think.  I wonder if the packets can be interfering with each other somehow.

HERTZ
Einstein, the same material that reacts to light, producing electricity, will produce light if we push electricity through it.

EINSTEIN
You have great control over the amount of electricity you push through the material, yes?

HERTZ
Yes, we do.  We can restrict the electrical current until the light should come out one infinitesimally small wave.

EINSTEIN
Or only one point, or packet at a time.  We need a more Greek sounding name.  Something related to the electron that causes the light to emit.  Something like: photon.

HERTZ
Emitted photon by photon, one photon cannot interfere with another.  The photons must collect in two clumps, one behind each slit.

Scene 5
Twentieth Century Europe

SCHRODINGER
Give me a break, Bohr.  The photon interferes with itself?

BOHR
Schrodinger, they’re being shot one at a time.  Can you offer another explanation?

SCHRODINGER
Maybe we should take a closer look.  We can watch each photon pass through its slit.

BOHR
Photon number 1, right.  Photon 2, right.  Photon 3, left.

SCHRODINGER
(Pause)
Photon number gazillion and 1, left.

BOHR
A pattern is beginning to form.  The photons are clumping behind each slit.

SCHRODINGER
But only when we observe which slit the photon passes through?
BOHR
Yes.  I’ve never seen anything analogous.

SCHRODINGER
…and the cat lives in superposition with its dead self, until we open the box and observe whether or not a quantum event killed the cat.  Can you tell I hate cats?

BOHR
Thank you for that simplifying analogy, Schrodinger.  Please tell me if I understand you, that the photon does not pass through the left slit or the right slit until we observe which slit it transits?

SCHRODINGER
That is correct.  Like the cat’s life, transit through the left slit and right slit remain superposed until we observe which slit the particle passes through.

BOHR
What sort of solipsism are you claiming?  That nothing actually exists until a person observes it?

SCHRODINGER
I am merely quoting the wave equation, and no, I’m not promoting solipsism, Bohr.  The Englishman, Penrose, believes interaction between the photon and the apparatus cause reduction to an actual path, the use of one slit or the other.  Others believe it is consciousness itself that causes collapse, and recent experiments point in that direction.

BOHR
But we’re physicists.  Who is expounding this idea of consciousness causing reality?

SCHRODINGER
It’s the Nobel Laureate Wigner; the guy who drove Szilard to Einstein’s house to kick start the Manhattan Project during the war.

Scene 6
Twentieth Century US 
WIGNER’S FRIEND
(opens the box and looks inside)
What is wrong? I see Dr. Schrodinger’s cat remains both alive and dead.

(WIGNER returns to the lab)

WIGNER’S FRIEND
(turns toward WIGNER)
Dr. Wigner, thank goodness you’re returned. I’ve observed the cat, but it remains in superposition!

WIGNER
Of course!  You and the cat comprise a quantum system.  You yourself must be observed to reduce the actual state of the cat.

WIGNER’S FRIEND
So if I observe the cat while you observe me the cat will reduce to alive or dead?

WIGNER
No, because you, the cat, and I also comprise a quantum system.  I must also be observed.

WIGNER’S FRIEND
Then your observer should also be observed!

WIGNER
Yes, you begin to see the problem.

WIGNER’S FRIEND
A problem that could go on indefinitely, each observer requiring observation.

WIGNER
Not indefinitely.  At the end, pervasive consciousness must be observing all.  A “Cosmic Consciousness.”

WIGNER’S FRIEND
(turns back and looks into the box)
The cat lives!  The cat’s life, our lives, all matter, exist thanks to Cosmic Consciousness? 
NARATOR There are other explanations.  Some of the wildest notions about the nature of reality have been offered as explanations for the double slit experiment.  In 1959, the idea that the photon passes through both slits, each in its own universe, led to the theory we occupy an infinite number of universes.  Only last year new work was published surmising that we occupy parallel universes, but the number of them is actually 41.  Neither have we thought of ways to test existence of other universes.

So what creates reality?  We stand between Penrose’s purely physical explanation on one hand, and Wigner’s Cosmic Consciousness on the other.  Seeking the truth of light, wave or particle, we’ve discovered mystery nobody imagined when the double slit experiment was performed in 1909.  We’ve repeated the experiment with electrons.  We’ve repeated the experiment with large molecules.  What we observe is very much a part of what it means to be human, to be matter, to be anything.  We continue to debate, to explore ideas, and hopefully we will continue to experiment, to test our ideas objectively.

First century middle east

PHARISEE
“He was a tekton, a common laborer.”

CHRISTIAN
“He was a great rabbi.”

PHARISEE
“Rabbi?  He violated the sabbath!”

CHRISTIAN
“He taught that law should serve all people, not only the high born.”

PHARISEE
“He fomented unrest.”

CHRISTIAN
“He taught us to help each other.”

PHARISEE
“He was a seditious criminal.”

CHRISTIAN
“He was god.”

PHARISEE
Come on, everyone knows God is a pillar of smoke!  Are you crazy?

CHRISTIAN
How would I know? Psychiatry hasn’t been invented.

PHARISEE
Psy..TONGUES!  You speak in tongues!  Demons possess you!

CHRISTIAN
You say that to whoever disagrees with you.

PHARISEE
You can’t even agree amongst yourselves what happened.

CHRISTIAN
We know he was executed for the rights of common people and an end to tribalism.

PHARISEE
You’d better watch what you say, here comes Constantine.

Scene 7.5
Jump ahead 200 years

CONSTANTINE
How am I supposed to run an empire populated by nattering plurality?  Go to Nicea.  Create orthodoxy!

Scene 8
Twenty-first century SF

WOMAN
Who knew you could learn so much watching waves?

MAN
It helps to have an expert to watch them with.  I guess he wasn’t casing cars.

WOMAN
We’re lucky he wasn’t put off by our suspicious looks.  It would be hard to blame a person for reacting badly to that kind of greeting.

MAN
Funny how we create reality, just by choosing how we observe it.  It’s almost a law of nature.
